## Abstract
In the evolving landscape of deep learning, the challenge of domain adaptation remains a critical issue, particularly in the context of image classification tasks. This study introduces a novel approach to mitigate the effects of domain shift through the use of activation shaping techniques applied to the ResNet-18 convolutional neural network. By modifying activation maps within the network, we explored two main strategies: the application of random activation maps and the implementation of unsupervised domain adaptation.
